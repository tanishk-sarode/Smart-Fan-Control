# Smart Fan Control System (Simulated on Wokwi)

This project simulates a dual-temperature-controlled fan system using two DHT22 sensors and a relay module. If the indoor temperature is less than outdoor, the fan turns ON to increase the indoor temperature.

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [Wokwi Project](https://wokwi.com/projects/378112823803002881)

## Features
- Reads temperature and humidity from two DHT22 sensors
- Uses relay logic to simulate fan ON/OFF
- Status LED reflects fan status
- Can be deployed on Arduino Uno or TI LaunchPad (with minor adjustments)
